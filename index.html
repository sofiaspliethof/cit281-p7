            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p> This project is an opportunity to create a CIT Minor portfolio using GitHub Pages.
                The goal is to build a personal or organization-level GitHub Page that serves as the main entry point, linking to individual repositories for each lab and project completed in CIT 281. 
                Each repo would have its own GitHub Page with descriptions, screenshots, and details about what was learned.
